Project 5

What I did - use the pthread and semaphore libraries to solve the smoker's problem as described in project 5.
How to compile - gcc -w -std=c99 cig.c -o cig
How to run - ./cig
What it does - 
  1. Initializes all threads (3 agents, 3 pushers, 6 smokers)
  2. Agents make available two different kinds of resources
  3. When a resource is made available, pushers watch and alert a smoker that can use the available resources
  4. When a smoker is alerted, it consumes the resources and smokes a cigarette, then rests for a short period.
  5. The Agents complete execution once they have released 6 of each of their resources
  6. The Pushers complete execution once they track and manage resources 12 times
  7. The Smokers complete execution once they create and smoke 3 cigarettes
